Hi! 👋

I’m Mihai Nițu, a junior software developer and ex QA engineer. 

I like to automate every task I can, but only if it really needs to be automated.

My preferred technologies to work with are Python, Playwright, Linux, and PostgreSQL, but I'd also like to get into MongoDB, N8N, and any cloud technology I can.

The main project I work on now is a [Python automation framework using Playwright](github.com/MAnitsu/PlaywrightFramework).

Fun facts:
- I have 2 cats
- My hobbies are: reading, fitness, gadgets, and strategy games
- I like black coffee
