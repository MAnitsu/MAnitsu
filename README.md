Hi! 👋

I’m Mihai Nițu, a junior software developer and ex QA engineer. 

I like to automate every task I can, but only if it really needs to be automated.

The main project I work on now is a [Python automation framework using Playwright](https://github.com/MAnitsu/PlaywrightFramework).

---

My preferred technologies to work with are:
- Python
- Playwright
- Linux
- PostgreSQL

I'd also like to get into:
- MongoDB
- N8N
- any cloud technology I can

A bit about me:
- I have 2 🐈cats🐈
- My hobbies are: reading, fitness, gadgets, and strategy games
- I like black coffee ☕
